## Development Tools

Webcomic uses a variety of open source software to manage development; you'll
want to at least install [Composer], [Node], [PHP 7] with [php-ast] and
[xdebug], [Vagrant], and [VirtualBox]. If you're working on a Mac you can
install the suggested software using [Homebrew Bundle].

You can install the development dependencies and launch the development
environment with:

```sh
npm install; npm start
```

A set of automation tasks is available through [npm] to help with processing
assets and running tests. You can see a list of available tasks with:

```sh
npm run
```

The `test` box hosts a WordPress multisite install with a set of development
plugins network-activated and the [WordPress Theme Unit Test Data] pre-loaded.
Some box administration tools are available at the `admin` subdomain (e.g.
`admin.webcomic.localhost`). Use the username and password `root` to login to
WordPress and the box administration tools.

## Coding Standards

Webcomic adheres to a customized version of the [WordPress Coding Standards] and
uses the [WordPress PHPUnit Test Framework]. Before submitting a pull request
you should:

1. Resolve or annotate any coding standard issues.
2. Add tests to cover all changes.
3. Verify that all new and existing tests pass.

The `test` box hosts the database used to run PHPUnit tests. Group tests by
component (e.g. `@group collection`); add isolated tests to the `isolated` group
as well as their component group.
