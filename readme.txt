WebComic makes any WordPress theme webcomic ready by adding new template tags and widgets specifically designed for publishing webcomics.

== Description ==

WebComic makes any WordPress theme webcomic ready by adding additional functionality, template tags, and widgets specifically designed for publishing webcomics.

= New in 1.2 =

* __Automatic Post Creation:__ WebComic can now automatically create comic posts for orphaned comics or create a post for a comic during upload. This option is only available when using the _Date_ name format, and comic filenames must only contain date information.

= Major Features =

* __Flexible File Names:__ WebComic can find your comics using a date format of your choice (defaults to YYYY-MM-DD), post slugs, or entirely custom values defined by you using the comic_filename custom field.
* __Manage your Library:__ The Library allows you to manage your comics and their associated posts from within WordPress. View all of your posts and which comic they’re associated with, see which posts don’t have a comic (and which comics don’t have a post), and upload, rename, and delete comics through WordPress.
* __Organize your Chapters:__ The Chapters feature allows you to create volumes and chapters and assign posts to them. WebComic has a number of widgets and template tags designed to display your comics organized by volume and chapter.
* __Template Tags for WordPress Themes:__ Leverage WebComics new template tags and widgets to turn _any_ WordPress theme into a webcomic site.

WebComic also takes advantage of WordPress custom fields to provide a simple way of adding custom comic descriptions and comic transcripts.

= New Widgets =

* __Chapter Archive:__ Displays your entire comic archive, organized by volume, chapter, and page.
* __Dropdown Comics:__ Displays a dropdown menu listing all of your comics. Options include the ability to group posts by chapter or chapters by volume and to automatically number posts or chapters. This widget requires additional javascript functionality to work correctly.
* __Random Comic:__ Displays a random comic as a simple text link, an image, or a linked image.
* __Recent Comics:__ Displays a list of your recently posted comics (up to ten) as simple text links, images, or linked images.
* __Recent Posts:__ WebComic modifies the standard Recent Posts widget to ignore your comic posts.

* Includes _Automatic Post Creation_. When enabled, WebComic will attempt to create a new comic post during upload. This option is only available when using the _Date_ name format, and comics must only have date information in their filename.
* Added _Generate Missing Posts_ option to the Library page. WebComic will attempt to create comic posts for orphaned comics when activated. This option is only available when using the _Date_ name format, and comics must only have date information in their filename.
