= Feature Highlights =

- **Comic Publishing Power:** Stop hacking WordPress and start using it. WebComic's simple configuration, library management, chapter organization and new template tags for WordPress themes give you the power to take control of your comic and your site to make it exactly what you want.
- **Multi-Comic Support:** One comic not enough? WebComic can manage any number of webcomics on a single WordPress site; just select two or more Comic Categories and WebComic takes care of the rest. And if that weren't enough, you can load entirely separate WordPress themes for different comic series.
- **Integrated Transcribing:** Say goodbye to [ohnorobot](http://ohnorobot.com/). WebComic's fully-integrated transcription system provides automatic indexing of published transcripts for site searches, the ability to request improvement of transcripts from users, and allow users to submit new transcripts.
- **Chapter Organization:** Take control of your storylines. WebComic's Chapter system utilizes the WordPress Taxonomy API to provide an entirely new, independent method of organizing comic posts that doesn't interfere with post categories and tags. Use all three to create infinitely complext storylines.
- **Library Management:** Config files? Dates in filenames? Not here. WebComic provides a simple configuration page and robust but easy-to-use comic management right through WordPress. Name your comics whatever you want, automatically generate posts for orphaned comics, and more.
- **Internationalization Support:** The world is a big place, and WebComic understands that. It might even speak your lanuage. If it doesn't, though, that's alright. WebComic utilizes WordPress' I18n functions for localization, allowing it to be fully translated into a language near you.
- **Much More:** For a complete overview of all the features WebComic provides please see the [comparison](http://maikeruon.com/wcib/documentation/comparison/), [release notes](http://maikeruon.com/wcib/documentation/webcomic/release-notes/), and [documentation](http://maikeruon.com/wcib/documentation/webcomic/)

To take full advantage of WebComic, you'll need at least some understanding of creating or modifying WordPress themes. If this sounds scary, check out [InkBlot](http://maikeruon.com/wcib/documentation/inkblot/), a highly customizable WordPress theme specifically designed to work with WebComic.
