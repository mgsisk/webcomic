# Support

Thanks for creating with Webcomic! The following resources are available to
help you make the most of it.

## [User Guide]

If you don't know where to start, start with the User Guide. The User Guide
explains how Webcomic works and how to use it to turn your WordPress-powered
site into a comic publishing platform.

## [Support Forum]

If you've read the User Guide and still have questions the Support Forum may
have answers. The Support Forum is for general discussion about and help with
Webcomic.

## [Discord Server ![Discord shield][img-discord]][url-discord]

If you enjoy real-time interaction you may prefer the Discord Server over the
Support Forum. The Discord Server provides both public and [patron-only]
channels.

## [Issue Tracker ![Issues shield][img-issues]][url-issues]

If you've found a bug in Webcomic or want to suggest a new featureÂ you should
file an issue in the Issue Tracker. The Issue Tracker is for discussing
specific issues that can be assigned to a contributor, organized with labels,
and grouped into milestones to help drive development.

## [Contact Mike]

If all else fails, you can try contacting the lead developer directly. A
response isn't guaranteed, but Mike does his best to answer questions as he can.
